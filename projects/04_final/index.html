		<div class="intro"><p>welcome to risd! this may not be johnson and wales, but there is still a food experience in store for you! and this may not be brown, but you are still the architect of your own education!</p><br />
		now that you've finally moved in, let's see if your roommate put any food in the fridge.</div>
		<div class="fridgeinfo"><p>congrats!! you've found food! okay, so the food may not look the most delicious, or most edible, or the most realistic, but did you really think we'd let you practice on real food? we don't want to set off any fire alarms.</p><br />
		speaking of fire alarms, let's heat something up.</div>
		<div class="mtext"><p>i mean... you can just leave it there. or you can try turning it on? must i tell you how to do everything?</p></div>
		<div class="done"><p>done! or at least i think it is? it's impossible to tell, really. but i assure you that it's finished.</p><br />
		<p>now, why don't we try eating our creation?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="gone"><p>gone! did it taste like anything? no?</p><br />
		<p>then maybe it's time to finally <a href="microfridge.html">move on.</a></p>
