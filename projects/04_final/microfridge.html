		<div class="bmuffind"><p>yeah... so it looks like your roommate already went to the met and brought back 7 banana muffins. wrapped in paper napkins because what are ozzi boxes? they're her favorite. she'd probably let you eat some, right? like â€” 7 is pretty excessive.</p></div>

		<div class="pbjd"><p>it's peanut butter jelly time</p></div>
		<div class="muffind"><p>it looks like your roommate brought back another muffin. the post-it says <span style="font-family: monospace;">"PUT IT BACK NOW!"</span> do you think that means put it back now? or now? ... or now?</p></div>

		<div class="pizzad"><p>listen... if you're up this late, it should mean that you're probably doing something productive and you need the fuel so...</p></div>
		<div class="bananad"><p>sometimes, at this hour, your friend gets drunk, knocks on your door, and asks for a banana to cure his hangover.</p></div>
		<div class="gone"><p>double click = nom nom. so yes, it disappeared. and no, you're not allowed to get it back. once you eat something, it doesn't automatically reappear again. this is the real world. (but then again, it really isn't. so if you do want it back, i guess you can just refresh the page, and ignore the wishes of this site's creator :') but that wouldn't be very polite of you, would it? we're aiming for realism here.)</p></div>
		<div class="muffinno"><p>are you serious? you know what that does! you can't just eat your roommate's muffins all the time. she already threatens to file a roommate change request every other day.</p></div>
		<div class="bananano"><p>if you eat this banana, what will you give your friend? nothing? then you wouldn't be friends anymore, genius.</p></div>
		<div class="done"><p>done!</p></div>
