    	<h1>Hard Feelings</h1>
		<!--verse 1-->
		<p>(Go back and tell it)</p>
		<p>Please could you be tender</p>
		<p>And I will sit close to you</p>
		<p>Let’s give it a minute before we admit that we’re through</p>
		<p>Guess this is the winter</p>
		<p>Our bodies are young and blue</p>
		<p>I’m at Jungle City, it’s late and this song is for you</p>

		<!--pre chorus--> 
		<p>Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us</p>
		<p>Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust</p>
		<p>Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost</p>
		<p>Well I guess I should go</p>
		<p>Yeah I guess I should go</p>


		<!--chorus--> 
		<p>Hard feelings—</p>
		<p>These are what they call hard feelings of love</p>
		<p>When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold</p>
		<p>Alone with the hard feelings of love</p>
		<p>God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home</p>

		<!--verse 2-->
		<p>I light all the candles</p>
		<p>Cut flowers for all my rooms</p>
		<p>I care for myself the way I used to care about you</p>
		<p>These days, we kiss and we keep busy</p>
		<p>The waves come after midnight</p>
		<p>I call from underwater</p>
		<p>Why even try to get right?</p>
		<p>When you’ve outgrown a lover</p>
		<p>The whole world knows but you</p>
		<p>It’s time to let go of this endless summer afternoon</p>

		<!--chorus--> 
		<p>Hard feelings—</p>
		<p>These are what they call hard feelings of love</p>
		<p>When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold</p>
		<p>Alone with the hard feelings of love</p>
		<p>God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home</p>

		<!--instrument break--> 

		<!--outro--> 
		<p>Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me</p>
		<p>Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don’t need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave</p>
		<p>But I still remember everything, how we’d drift buying groceries, how you’d dance for me</p>
		<p>I’ll start letting go of little things 'til I’m so far away from you, far away from you, yeah</p>
